TODO:
- reuse index and skip tests if same block as previous call to read_z_*
- support custom alphabets in Z5 onwards
- allow delay/routine in read_text
- rewrite floppy access code to use all available sectors
- use more memory, $E000-$FFFF, perhaps also $D000-$E000?
- support splitting of large files onto two floppies

DONE:
