Drives and devices
------------------
A game built using Ozmoo is placed on one or more disks. These disks can then be used in different disk drive devices attached to the C64. The device numbers which can be used are 8, 9, 10, 11. Two different story disks can not use the same device number.


Build modes
-----------

Notes: 

* Preloading means some or all of memory is filled with suitable parts of the story file, by loading this content from a file as the game starts. Using preloading speeds up game start for many players since this initial loading sequence can use any fastloader the user may have enabled. It also means gameplay is as fast as it gets, right from the start.

* Less RAM available for virtual memory system: This means a smaller part of C64 memory can be used for virtual memory handling, which means the game will need to load sectors from disk more often. This will of course slow the game down.

Modes not requiring a disk drive for play:
---
P: Program file
	Story file size < ~51 KB: Using full amount of RAM.
	Story file size < ~40 KB: You may use flag -r to only use RAM up to $CFFF. This means all RAM can be accessed directly without buffers, which makes the interpreter smaller and the game faster.

	Disks used:
		* Boot / Story disk. This contains a single file, which may be moved to any other medium, like another disk image or a tape image.


Modes requiring a single 1541 drive for play:
---
S1: Single 1541 drive, one disk
	Story file size < ~140 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~180 KB: Less preloading the larger the story file. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.

	Disks used:
		* Boot / Story disk
	
S2: Single 1541 drive, two disks
	Story file size < ~210 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~230 KB: Full preloading. Less RAM available for virtual memory system the larger the story file.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk
		* Story disk
	
Modes requiring two 1541 drives for play:
---
D2: Double 1541 drives, two disks
	Story file size < ~330 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~370 KB: Less preloading the larger the story file. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk / Story disk A
		* Story disk B

D3: Double 1541 drives, three disks
	Story file size < ~400 KB: Full preloading. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~420 KB: Full preloading. Less RAM available for virtual memory system the larger the story file.

	Disks used:
		* Boot disk
		* Story disk A
		* Story disk B
	
Modes requiring a 1571, a 1581 or an SD2IEC:
---
To be added at a later date. A single drive 1571 mode could be used for story files up to about 360 KB in size. 1581 and SD2IEC modes could enable full 512 KB story sizes.

Interpreter config
------------------
Interpreter configuration is stored in two blocks on the boot disk (track 19, sector 0-1). The interpreter loads this information when it starts.

Contents:
4 bytes: Game signature: A checksum of the story file contents, the build mode and the interpreter version.

--- Disk information block ---
1 byte: Number of bytes used for disk information, including this byte
1 byte: Interleave (in range 1-21)
1 byte: Number of save slots which can fit on a disk (in range 4-132)
1 byte: Number of disks used (disk 0 is the save disk(s), disk 1 .. are game disks
For each disk:
		1 byte: n: Number of bytes used for this entry, including this byte.
		1 byte: Device#. If device# is < 8 or > 11, interpreter should halt and tell user to run setup program.
		2 bytes: Last story block # + 1 (high endian) on this disk 
		1 byte: t: Number of tracks used for story data (If this number is > 0, this is a story disk!)
		t bytes: Sectors used for story data: Bit 0-4: # of sectors used. Bit 5-7: First sector# used. (Example: %01010000: Use 16 sectors, starting with #2)
		x bytes: Disk name in Petscii. Special codes:
			0: End of string
			128: "Boot "
			129: "Story "
			130: "Save "
			131: "disk "

--- Vmem information block ---
1 byte: Number of bytes used for vmem information, including this byte
1 byte: Number of vmem blocks suggested for initial caching
1 byte: Number of vmem blocks already preloaded
x bytes: vmap_z_h contents for the suggested blocks
x bytes: vmap_z_l contents for the suggested blocks


Typical size for a 3-disk ( + save disk) game:

4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 5) + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 100 + 100 = 
8 + 2 * 50 + 2 * 8 + 203 = 
8 + 100 + 16 + 203 = 
327 bytes

An interpreter needs to reserve this space for disk information:
z3: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 6) = 4 + 2 * 8 + 51 = 71 bytes
z4/z5/z8:  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3) + 2 * (1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 40 + 5) = 4 + 2 * 8 + 2 * 50 = 120 bytes

Possible 1581 drive support: This system should work, without extending the limits above, using only 31 sectors per track for story data, while allowing z8 games of up to 512 KB in size on a single disk.

Possible 1571 support:
	z3 games: No change
	z4/z5 games: A single disk using only track 1-53 can hold all story data. Disk information will then fit in less than the number of bytes stated above.
	z8 games: Disk information for a single drive game will fit in the number of bytes stated above. Double 1571 drive support is possible but not a high priority.
