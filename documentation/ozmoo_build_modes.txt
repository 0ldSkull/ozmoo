Notes: 

* Initial caching means some or all of memory is filled with suitable parts of the story file, by loading this content from a file as the game starts. Using initial caching speeds up game start for many players since this initial loading sequence can use any fastloader the user may have enabled. It also means gameplay is as fast as it gets, right from the start.

* Less RAM available for virtual memory system: This means a smaller part of C64 memory can be used for virtual memory handling, which means the game will need to load sectors from disk more often. This will of course slow the game down.

Modes requiring a single 1541 drive for play:
---
S1: One 1541 disk
	Story file size < ~140 KB: Full initial caching. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~180 KB: Less initial caching the larger the story file. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.

S2: Two 1541 disks
	Story file size < ~210 KB: Full initial caching. Full amount of RAM available for virtual memory system.
	Story file size < ~230 KB: Full initial caching. Less RAM available for virtual memory system the larger the story file.
