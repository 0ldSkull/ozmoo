Flags which can be used to affect how the interpreter is built
----

The flags described here can be set on the Acme commandline using the syntax -D[flag]=1


General flags:

DEBUG
	Print debug information, print descriptive error messages, store a trace of the instructions which have been executed and print them in case of an exception. Also check section "Debug flags" below.
NEW_MORE_PROMPT
	Use the new MORE prompt, which takes up less screen real-estate.
SWEDISH_CHARS
	Map Swedish characters in ZSCII to their PETSCII equivalents.
VMEM
	Utilize virtual memory. Without this, the complete game must fit in C64 RAM available above the interpreter and below $D000, all in all about 40 KB. Also check section "Virtual memory flags" below. 
ALLRAM
	Utilize all available RAM for game data (Not setting it means RAM at $D000-$FFFF will not be used.)
Z3
	Build the interpreter to run Z-machine version 3 games.
Z4
	Build the interpreter to run Z-machine version 4 games.
Z5
	Build the interpreter to run Z-machine version 5 games.
Z8
	Build the interpreter to run Z-machine version 8 games.


Virtual memory flags
---
(These flags don't do anything unless the VMEM flag has been specified.)

SMALLBLOCK
	When using virtual memory, use a blocksize of 512 bytes rather than 1024 bytes.
	
	
Debug flags 
---
(These flags don't do anything unless the DEBUG flag has been specified.)
	
BENCHMARK
	When the game starts, replay a number of colon-separated commands which have been stored with the interpreter (in the file text.asm). Charcode 255 in this command sequence means print the number of jiffies since the computer was started.
PRINT_SWAPS
	Print information whenever a memory block is loaded into memory.
TRACE
	Print trace information.
TRACE_FLOPPY
	Print trace information for floppy operations.
TRACE_FLOPPY_VERBOSE
	Print verbose trace information for floppy operations.
TRACE_PRINT_ARRAYS
	?
TRACE_READTEXT
	Print trace information for opcode read/aread/sread.
TRACE_SHOW_DICT_ENTRIES
	?
TRACE_TOKENISE
	Print trace information for the tokenization process.
TRACE_VM
	Print trace information for the virtual memory system.
TRACE_VM_PC
	?
TRACE_WINDOW
	?
VMEM_OPTIMIZE
	Built the interpreter in PREOPT mode (used to pick which virtual memory blocks should be preloaded into memory when the game starts).
