Colours in Z-code games
-----------------------
make.rb has the following switches to control colours:

-rc:(Z-code colour)=(C64 colour), ...
	Replace colours: Replaces one or more colours in the Z-code palette with the specified colours in the C64 palette.

-dc:(Default background colour):(Default foreground colour)
	Default colours: This picks the Z-code colours to use as default background and foreground colours.

-sc:(Statusline colour)
	Statusline colour: This picks the Z-code colour to use as statusline colour. This is only possible with version 3 story files (z3).
	
Z-code has a palette of 8 colours, numbered 2-9:

  2 = black       
  3 = red         
  4 = green       
  5 = yellow      
  6 = blue        
  7 = magenta     
  8 = cyan        
  9 = white       

The Commodore 64 has 16 colours, numbered 0-15:

  0 = black
  1 = white
  2 = red
  3 = cyan
  4 = purple
  5 = green
  6 = blue
  7 = yellow
  8 = orange
  9 = brown
 10 = pink
 11 = dark grey
 12 = grey
 13 = light green
 14 = light blue
 15 = light grey

Examples
--------

Use cyan text on black background with a yellow statusbar (only works for z3!):

make.rb -dc:2,8 -sc:5 game.z3


Change so Z-code color 7 is dark grey instead of magenta and Z-code color 8 is light grey instead of cyan, and use these as default colors:

make.rb -rc:7=11,8=15 -dc:7,8 game.z5


Setting up the default palette (even though this isn't useful) is equivalent to using:

make.rb -rc:2=0,3=2,4=5,5=7,6=6,7=4,8=3,9=1 game.z5
