Ideas for tasks / subprojects to do next
----------------------------------------
Fix random opcode (see notes under Instructions... below)

Timed input

Color support

Basic sound effect support (low-pitched beep and high-pitched beep)

Create PETSCII <-> ZSCII conversion routines. Make them fast.

System to enable support for Swedish, German, French games etc. Maybe with option to include custom character set?

save/restore
	Copy SP and PC to below stack. Save this, stack and dynmem as one file.

catch/throw

Buffering/word wrap

[MORE] prompts

Create our own screen handling routines to give us full control, including not scrolling status line off screen.

Extend virtual memory RAM up to $ffff (And disable trace automatically if RAM at page $cf00 is used for Vmem)

Make memory reading more efficient. While reading continuous memory, we only need to check RAM address at first byte and when entering a new page.

Put first four entries of z_operand_value_(low/high)_arr on zeropage. Saves 200+ bytes and makes all instructions faster.

Figure out how to best place loader, interpreter and different parts of story file on 1, 2 or 3 disk sides.

Add fast-loader code?

Create easy-to-use tool (Wizard style?) to pick a story file and build disk image(s) with the right interpreter etc. Shouldn't require building anything from source code, installing third-party software etc.

Possible alternative versions / extensions
------------------------------------------
* Support for C1581 disks (can hold 3160 blocks of user data)
* Support for SD2IEC, which can use fileseek operators to load any part of a file in the file system.
* Support for REU
* C128 version which can use a C1571, additional RAM and 80-column mode.
