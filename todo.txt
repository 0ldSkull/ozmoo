Ideas for tasks / subprojects to do next
----------------------------------------

*** Speed ***
- Figure out what the cause of slowness in printing the test suite names in Praxix is. See if it can be made faster.
- Setup profiling, where we can see how much time is spent in different instructions over a session (Log # of executions and # of timer ticks).
- Optimise find_word_in_dictionary by stopping when searching > word. Possibly also use binary search to search dictionary faster.
- Make memory reading more efficient. While reading continuous memory, we only need to check RAM address at first byte and when entering a new page.
    Old todo: - reuse index and skip tests if same block as previous call to read_z_*
- Add fast-loader code?

Create PETSCII <-> ZSCII conversion routines. Make them fast.

- support custom alphabets in Z5 onwards

System to enable support for Swedish, German, French games etc. Maybe with option to include custom character set?

Timed input
Old todo: - allow delay/routine in read_text

Color support

Basic sound effect support (low-pitched beep and high-pitched beep)

save/restore
	Copy SP and PC to below stack. Save this, stack and dynmem as one file.

Buffering/word wrap

[MORE] prompts

Create our own screen handling routines to give us full control, including not scrolling status line off screen.

Extend virtual memory RAM up to $ffff (And disable trace automatically if RAM at page $cf00 is used for Vmem)
Old todo: - use more memory, $E000-$FFFF, perhaps also $D000-$E000?

Put first four entries of z_operand_value_(low/high)_arr on zeropage. Saves 200+ bytes and makes all instructions faster.

Figure out how to best place loader, interpreter and different parts of story file on 1, 2 or 3 disk sides.
Old todo: - rewrite floppy access code to use all available sectors
Old todo: - support splitting of large files onto two floppies

Create easy-to-use tool (Wizard style?) to pick a story file and build disk image(s) with the right interpreter etc. Shouldn't require building anything from source code, installing third-party software etc.

Improve ZSCII / PETSCII conversion with special cases for accented characters

DONE:
- the .block range in readblocks need to be increased

Fix random opcode (see notes under Instructions... below)

- Czech tests: https://github.com/DustinCampbell/ZGo/tree/master/zcode/czech
  https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXinterpretersXtools.html

- space, comma, newline, printx, printy, printa, etc. only in DEBUG

catch/throw



Possible alternative versions / extensions
------------------------------------------
* Support for C1581 disks (can hold 3160 blocks of user data)
* Support for SD2IEC, which can use fileseek operators to load any part of a file in the file system.
* Support for REU
* C128 version which can use a C1571, additional RAM and 80-column mode.
